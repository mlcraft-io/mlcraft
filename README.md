__MLCraft is a low-code metrics layer and a modern open-source alternative to Looker.__ 

MLCraft (Metrics Layer Craft) originally was designed to extract and transform the data from several data warehouses and run machine learning experiments. [Cube.js](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/) is used as a primary query layer and makes it suitable for handling
trillions of data points.

We offer a new way of working with data – it's called metrics store.

* Access insights with confidence, keep teams up-to-date on metrics changes, build institutional knowledge with stakeholders to empower your decision-making

* Take advantage of an enterprise-level metrics platform that allows you to visualize key insights via an easy GraphQL API or JDBC client

* Create individual dashboards for different roles and teams or stakeholder groups, and track changes across multiple data sources with a unified dashboard

## Features
* **Data modeling**: a [Cube.js](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/) Data Schema is used to model raw data into meaningful business metrics, transform and pre-aggregate data for optimal results.
* **Version control**: manage schema changes with version control, rollback fast to the valid one.
* **Auto testing and documentation**: good documentation and data testing will help downstream consumers curate the datasets.
* **Metrics Governance**: keep an eye on metrics changes, know data owners and contributors, understand the context rapidly.
* **Multitenancy and row-level security**: collaborate on the metrics and warehouses together with your team.
* **Query orchestration and multi-level caching**: any production-ready analytics solution requires key components such as analytic SQL generation, query results caching and execution orchestration.

note: not all features are deployed yet. Please, sync with our [roadmap](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/projects). Leave your email in the newsletter form on [mlcraft.io](https://mlcraft.io) if you would know about new features.

## Demo

Demo: [app.mlcraft.org](https://app.mlcraft.org)

Login: `demo@mlcraft.io`

Password: `demodemo`

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

### Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The [mlcraft-io/mlcraft/install-manifests](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/tree/main/install-manifests) repo
contains all installation manifests required to deploy MLCraft anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

```
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/main/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/main/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 2: Run MLCraft

The following command will run MLCraft along with a Postgres database to store its data.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
c8f342d086f3 mlcraft/mlcraft-stack ... 1m ago  Up 1m  80->8888/tcp ...
30ea14ddaa5e postgres:12           ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp    
```

It will take about 2-5 minutes to install all dependencies, wait until `MLCraft Stack is ready` message.
Read logs by `docker-compose logs -f` to understand if it's finished.

### Step 3: Try out MLCraft

MLCraft itself will be available on `http://localhost/`

GraphQL endpoint will be `http://localhost/v1/graphql`

Admin Console (Hasura Console) will be available on `http://localhost/console`

NOTE: check out `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` in the `docker-compose` file. You'll need it to enter the Admin Console.

## Local development 

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- Python3 (with pip3)
- Node.js 8.9+ with `yarn` installed

```
git clone https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft.git
cd mlcraft
bash init.sh
```

To start UI in dev mode:

```
python3 cli.py ui
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

To start containers manually:

```
python3 cli.py services up
```

To destroy all services (volumes will still present):

```
python3 cli.py services destroy
```

Also check:

```
python3 cli.py --help
```

### ngrok tunells
  
[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a tool for allow you to instantly open access to remote systems. We use it for proxying requests from dockerized apps to frontend part in development mode.

After installing the tool you need to obtain your authtoken in ngrok dashboard and update the variable in `ngrok.yml` file. Then run `bash ngrok.sh` command.
It opens tunnels for backend, frontend and object storage services. Don't forget to change default routes by ngrok-generated ones.

It's necessary to test such features as scheduled reports and alerts locally.
