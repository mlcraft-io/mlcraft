__MLCraft is an open-source low-code business intelligence tool and a data science workflow.__ 

MLCraft was designed to query the data from several data warehouses and run machine learning experiments. [Cube.js](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/) is used as a primary query layer and makes it suitable for handling
trillions of data points.

Most modern RDBMS are supported.
